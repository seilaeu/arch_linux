Reparar sistema de ficheiros fat:

$ sudo dosfsck -w -r -l -a -v -t /dev/sdXY

If that command takes too much time for you, avoid -t switch.

    -w means write to disk immediately.
    -r means to do disk check interactively (ask you what to do to when encountering errors). On newer versions of dosfsck this   the default.
    -l means to list the filenames processed.
    -a means automatically fix errors. Do not use it, if You want to have more control over fixing possible errors.
    -v means verbose mode. Generates slightly more output.
    -t means mark unreadable clusters as bad.
