DMC firmware

Display Microcontroller firmware provides support for advanced graphics low-power idle states.

To configure to build the DMC firmware into the kernel binary, in this case, i915/skl_dmc_ver1_27.bin:

KERNEL (Prior to Linux 4.18) Build firmware blobs into the kernel binary
Device Drivers  --->
    Generic Driver Options  --->
        -*- Userspace firmware loading support
        [*] Include in-kernel firmware blobs in kernel binary
            (i915/skl_dmc_ver1_27.bin) External firmware blobs to build into the kernel binary
            (/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
KERNEL (Since Linux 4.18) Build firmware blobs into the kernel binary
Device Drivers  --->
    Generic Driver Options  --->
            Firmware loader  --->
                -*- Firmware loading facility
                (i915/skl_dmc_ver1_27.bin) Build named firmware blobs into the kernel binary
                (/lib/firmware) Firmware blobs root directory
 Warning
Including the firmware in-kernel may cause suspend-to-ram to fail, if this is a concern don't include the blob built into the kernel, instead, add the firmware blob into the initramfs.
